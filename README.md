- 👋 Hi, I’m @tgbernard19.
- 👀 I’m interested in complexity; natural systems; future and fate of life; computation; above all, philosophy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning microbiology (what are the principles governing microbial ecosystems? what implications does this have for macro-scale communities, ecological and otherwise?)
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn about math. Hit me up if you know how to build a math intuition quickly - please!
- 📫 How to reach me: tgbernard19@berkeley.edu
- ⚡ Fun fact: Matt Reardon said I was 80th percentile in earnestness, so I've got that going for me.
